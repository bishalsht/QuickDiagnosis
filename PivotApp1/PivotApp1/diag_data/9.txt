In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends patients receive one dose of human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) and four doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period.

Drugs:
If the patient has had no prior rabies vaccination, if he or she is of unknown status, or if more than 5 years have passed since his or her last vaccination, rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin should be administered as follows (these dosages being applicable to products available in the United States):
Rabies vaccine IM (deltoid) - 1 mL on days on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 (if immunocompromised, add an additional dose: 1 mL IM deltoid on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28)
Rabies immunoglobulin - 20 IU/kg infiltrated as much as feasible around and under the bite wound; if any left over, give IM (gluteus)

If the patient has had prior rabies vaccination, vaccine should be administered as follows (this dosage again being applicable to US vaccine): Rabies vaccine IM (deltoid) 1 mL on days on days 0 and 3. [Source: Medscape]
