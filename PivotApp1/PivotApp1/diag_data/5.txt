ALLERGY:
ABOUT:
An allergy is a hypersensitivity disorder of the immune system.
Allergic reactions occur when a person's immune system reacts to normally harmless substances in the environment.
A substance that causes a reaction is called an allergen. 
These reactions are acquired, predictable, and rapid.
Allergy is one of four forms of hypersensitivity and is formally called type I (or immediate) hypersensitivity.
Allergic reactions are distinctive because of excessive activation of certain white blood cells called mast cells and basophils by a type of antibody called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). 
This reaction results in an inflammatory response which can range from uncomfortable to dangerous.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:
Many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles.
In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as eyes, nose, and lungs. 
For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, itching, and redness of the eyes.
Inhaled allergens can also lead to asthmatic symptoms,increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath (dyspnea), coughing and wheezing.

CAUSES:
Risk factors for allergy can be placed in two general categories, namely host and environmental factors.
Host factors include heredity, gender, race, and age, with heredity being by far the most significant.
 However, there have been recent increases in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone.
Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.

DRUGS:
allergy shots
antihistamines
