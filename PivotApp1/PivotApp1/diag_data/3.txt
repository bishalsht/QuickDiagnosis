DIARRHOEA
ABOUT:
Diarrhea or diarrhoea (from the Greek  dia "through" + rheo "flow" meaning "flowing through") is the condition of having three or more loose or liquid bowel movements per day.
The most common cause is gastroenteritis.
It is a common cause of death in developing countries and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide. 
The loss of fluids through diarrhea can cause dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as potassium deficiency or other salt imbalances.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:
Loose bowel motions
high fever sometimes
headache possible


PREVENTION:
A rotavirus vaccine decrease the rates of diarrhea in a population.
New vaccines against rotavirus, Shigella, ETEC, and cholera are under development, as well as other causes of infectious diarrhea.
Probiotics decrease the risk of diarrhea in those taking antibiotics.
In institutions and in communities, interventions that promote hand washing lead to significant reductions in the incidence of diarrhea.

DRUGS:
ORS(oral rehydrated solution)
The PROBIOTIC LACTOBACILUS can help prevent antibiotic associated diarrhea in adults but possibly not children.
